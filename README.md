[Mitras | Linear Algebra Graphing Calculator](https://davidtranhq.github.io/mitras)

*mitras* is an online graphing calculator for 2D vectors and matrices. It supports calculations for n-dimensional vectors, matrices, and their related operations, including eigenvalues, eigenvectors, determinants, transposes, inverses, cross products, projections, and more.

Access it at [davidtranhq.github.io/mitras](https://davidtranhq.github.io/mitras).

## Details

The calculator is written in React + TypeScript. It uses MaterialUI for the UI, [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/) for LaTeX input, my own package [tex-math-parser](https://github.com/davidtranhq/tex-math-parser) for LaTeX parsing, and [MathJS](https://mathjs.org/) for computation. The graph itself is drawn using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.
