This MathQuill library was built from a fork of the original library that implements matrix support.

The original library: [mathquill/mathquill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill)

The matrix fork: [Learnosity/mathquill](https://github.com/Learnosity/mathquill)

My fork of the matrix fork that fixes build issues: [davidtranhq/mathquill](https://github.com/davidtranhq/mathquill)
